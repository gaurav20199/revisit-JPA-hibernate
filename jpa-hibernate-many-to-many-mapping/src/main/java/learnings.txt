Join Table::
Join Table is used when Hibernate is not able to create Foreign Keys.
It is usually created when we have Many to Many Mapping. Used to map multiple records of one entity to another.
This is only represent on DB Level and not on Object(Java Code) level.

1) We have to Use Join Table Annotation here as under the hood a join table will be created in the db.
2) Join Table will have information about join table name and join table columns name using Join Table and Inverse Join
Table property.
